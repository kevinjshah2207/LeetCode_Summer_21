#Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, 
#find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

#Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2, 
#where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length.

#The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the 
#same element twice.
